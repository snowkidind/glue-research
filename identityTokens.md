# Icon (ICX)

**Interconnecting blockchain network**

_Sector: fintech, medical, educational_

**Identity "token" that is passed around between entities, id token is used as a reference for transacting. The Identity is issued via a smart contract.**

"Blockchain ID" is one of the decentralized apps, or DApps, that make up the ICON network, and it provides new levels of security and identification. Members of the financial security community can use it to verify IDs in other communities. Blockchain ID works via Smart Contracts and will save time when verifying your identity to do things like get a student discount or open a bank account.

Editorial: ICX appears to see themselves as a one stop shop for blockchain where various tokens on the platform can interact with each other through smart contracts. An Identity is achieved upon a user creating a smart contract, and then interacting with other entities on the platform.

# Metaverse (ETP)

**Decentralized platform based on blockchain technology**

_Sector: fintech, credit / reputation, digital rights management_

**Avatar is ETP's digital Identity. Asset transactions use an Oracle**

The digital identity Avatar reflects the relationship between people, people and assets, and this Avatar can be linked to MST. Through the use of Avatars, anyone can become  value intermediary  Oracles,  and  Oracles  can  help  construct  an  immutable decentralized system. If  a person owns multiple digital identities and wants to open an account at Bank B, then he can indicate that he has already had an account at Bank A. End  users  will  be  able  to  use  their  digital  identity  to claim copyrights  and  other  assets.

>A Profile contains the following information:
>Personal transaction records
>Asset information
>Customized description field

Editorial:  I've gathered that the oracle stores this profile information which is accessible via (anything)
